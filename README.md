CS 4750 Database Systems Project

Link to the original repo: https://github.com/cfkim/pokemon-hospital

This is a health database website for nurses at a Pokemon hospital, providing a quick and efficient way for nurses to keep track of and update information about their Pokemon patients. Nurses can view and edit patients' profile information (such as their trainer's contact information, date of birth, health insurance, allergies), as well as add and remove patients from the system. If the user is a charge nurse, the user can also view and manage the profile information of the hospital's nurses.

Contributions include:
- Functionalities such as add/delete pokemon to database
- Pokemon search functionality
- The nurse "my profile" page
- Login/logout functionality
- UX Design (HTML, CSS)
